TinyML Driving style detection

This project is a part of a semester procjet in the course Tiny Machine Learning at AU Herning

This project uses Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) with an accelerometer and a Particle Photon 2 to detect if an ambulance is driving with sirens (emergency mode) or without sirens (normal driving).

In this project i will obtain data from an ambulance driving both with and without lights and sirens, using a Particle Photon 2 combined with an ADXL345 accelerometer.
The data will be used to train a ML model, making it able to detect if ambulance is driving in emergency mode or normal mode.
